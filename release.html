<p>Anonymous blocks are of course insanely cool.<br/>
Why explains it better in this short film:

<p>So what are we going to use it for? For making a builder (***link***) clone of course! Since what the world needs is yet another templating language. The usage of this library is different from the original Ruby Builder; since Python has no #method_missing you need to explicitly call the element (or tag) method.</p>

<pre>
    head = Element("head")
    with head as h:
        with h.tag("title") as t: t.text("builder.py")

    foo = XmlDocument("html", doctype='&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt;', attributes={ 'xmlns':"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml", 'lang':"en", 'xml:lang':"en"})
    foo.contents.append(head)
    with foo as f:
        with foo.tag("body") as body:
            with body.tag("p") as p:
                p.text("blah blah &amp; yadda yadda")
                p.comment("replace with praise for builder.py")
                p.tag("br")
                p.text("that's all!")
</pre>
